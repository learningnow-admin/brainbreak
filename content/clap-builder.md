We’re going to play a game called **Clap Builder**! Here’s how it works:

We start with **one simple clap**. Everyone does it together.  
Then, going around the circle, **each person adds one new clap or rhythm** to the pattern.  
Each time, we **repeat the full pattern** so far, then add the new move.

Your goal is to remember the **whole clapping sequence** and keep it going!

### Example Additions:

- Clap–Clap–Snap
- Clap thighs, then clap hands
- Clap, pause, clap
- Clap above head
- Double fast clap
- Clap, click tongue
- Stomp then clap

You can make it fun, silly, or tricky, just make sure everyone can copy it.
