We’re going to play a game called Table Top Drumming! Here’s how it works:

In small groups, take turns creating a rhythm by drumming on the table using your hands, fingers, or any objects you have nearby — like pens, pencils, or cups.

The rest of your group can either try to copy your rhythm or come up with their own.
