We’re going to play a game called No Smiling. Here’s how it works: I’ll need one volunteer to sit in the middle of the room. Everyone else will take their chairs and form a circle around that person. The volunteer’s job is to stay as serious and miserable as possible. Your job is to make the person in the middle smile or laugh. We’ll go around the circle, and each person will take a turn to try and make the volunteer smile. But no touching! After each attempt, the volunteer must say, 'I like you, friend, but I cannot smile.' The game ends when the person in the middle finally smiles or laughs.
