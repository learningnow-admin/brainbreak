We’re going to play a game called **Human Knot**! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands in a circle, shoulder to shoulder.  
Now, reach your **right hand** across the circle and grab someone else’s right hand.  
Next, reach your **left hand** across and grab a _different_ person’s left hand.  
Make sure you’re holding hands with two different people, not the ones next to you!

Now you’re in a **Human Knot**.  
Your goal is to **untangle the knot without letting go** of anyone’s hands.  
Talk to each other, step over arms, duck under whatever works but don’t let go.

When your group forms one big circle with no crossed arms, you’ve solved it!  
If it seems impossible, you can pause and restart.
