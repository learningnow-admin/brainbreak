We're going to do a thought experiment called **Brain in a Vat**. Here's how it works:

Imagine your brain has been removed from your body and placed in a vat of nutrients. Scientists have connected it to a supercomputer that perfectly simulates reality. Everything you see, hear, touch, and feel is fake — but it feels completely real.

**How would you know if this was happening to you right now?**

Stand up if you think you could prove you're NOT a brain in a vat.

Stay seated if you think there's no way to know for sure.

Everything you use to check reality — your senses, your memories, other people — could all be part of the simulation.

Does it matter if your experiences are "real" as long as they feel real to you?
