We’re going to play a game called Who is Most Likely To Be! Here’s how it works:

Take turns choosing one role from the list below.  
When it’s your turn, pick someone in the group who you think is most likely to become that person.  
You can give a fun or serious reason for your choice.

Once you’ve had your turn, the next person picks a **different** role and does the same.  
Let’s see what amazing futures we imagine for each other!
