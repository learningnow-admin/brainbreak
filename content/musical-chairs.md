We’re going to play a game called Musical Chairs! Here’s how it works:

We’ll set up a circle of chairs — but there will be **one less chair** than the number of players.  
When the music starts, everyone walks around the chairs.

As soon as the music stops, **find a seat as fast as you can**!  
The person left standing is out for the next round.  
We’ll remove one chair and start again.

The game continues until only one player is left sitting.

Remember: keep moving while the music plays and stay alert when it stops!
