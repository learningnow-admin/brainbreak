Use this chant to get the class's attention. Say each line out loud while doing the action -- students join in and follow along.

- **Hands on your shoulders** – "Big boulders!"
- **Hands on your knees** – "Buzzy buzzy bees!"
- **Hands on your chin** – "Let's begin!"
- **Hands on your chest** – "You're the best!"
- **Hands on your tummy** – "Something funny!"
- **Hands on your hair** – "Almost there!"
- **Hands on your feet** – "What a treat!"
- **Hands on your back** – "How are you Jack! Haven't seen you for ears and ears, but I still nose you!"

Repeat until everyone is settled and focused on you.
