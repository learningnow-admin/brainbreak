We’re going to play a game called **Kangaroos vs Crocodiles!** Here’s how it works:

You’ll stand in pairs, facing each other with a line between you.  
When a group name is called, it’s time to chase or escape!

Follow these steps:

- Pair up and stand facing your partner
- Place a line or cone between each pair
- Do actions like **jogging, jumping jacks, or squats**
- When the teacher calls **"Kangaroos!"**, they turn and **run**
- The other side (Crocodiles!) **chase and try to tag** them
- Switch roles each round
