We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Ring of Gyges**. Here's how it works:

In an ancient Greek story, a shepherd named Gyges finds a ring that makes him invisible. He uses it to sneak into the palace, seduce the queen, and kill the king to take power.

**Here's the question:** If you had a ring that made you completely invisible — and you knew you could never be caught — would you still follow the rules?

Stand up if you would stay completely moral even with the ring.

Stay seated if you think you might do things you wouldn't normally do.

Be honest with yourself. Why do we follow rules — because they're right, or because we fear getting caught?

Would a truly good person act the same whether anyone was watching or not?
