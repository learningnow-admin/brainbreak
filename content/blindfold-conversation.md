We’re going to play a game called Blindfold Conversation. Here’s how it works: One student sits blindfolded in the middle of a circle. I will pick someone from the circle, and that person will speak in a funny or disguised voice. The blindfolded student can ask questions or have a short conversation to figure out who is speaking. If they guess correctly, they switch places with the speaker. If they guess wrong, they stay in the middle, and another student is chosen. The goal is to use careful listening skills and have fun with creative voices.
