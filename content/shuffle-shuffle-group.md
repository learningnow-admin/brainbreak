We’re going to play a game called Shuffle Shuffle Group. Here’s how it works: Everyone will shuffle or move around the space randomly. At any moment, the teacher will call out, “Group of [a number]!” and you must quickly form groups with the exact number of people called. If someone is left out because the numbers don’t divide evenly, they are out for the rest of the game.
