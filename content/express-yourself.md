We’re going to play a game called Express Yourself! Here’s how it works:

I’ll say a phrase, and your job is to react with a facial expression that matches the situation.
For example, if I say, “You are going on an overseas holiday,” you might show excitement or surprise.

Each time I give a new phrase, quickly show the expression that fits.
Pay close attention, be creative, and let’s see who can be the most expressive!


- You just won the lottery
- You will need to stay back to finish this assignment
- Your cat just died
- OMG, why did you just do that?
- Ok, that looks more like a waterfall to me…
- You just stepped in something wet... with socks on
- You found a spider in your lunchbox
- You're meeting your hero
- You forgot it was picture day
- You just got caught sneaking a snack
- You're opening a mystery gift
- You hear your name during an award ceremony
- You just woke up and realized it's Monday
- You're about to ride a rollercoaster
- You tasted something really sour
- You just remembered your homework is due now
- You're trying not to laugh in class
- You hear a strange noise at night
- You finally solved a hard puzzle
- You just got a puppy
- You just saw a ghost
- You got exactly what you wanted for your birthday
- You're stuck in the rain without an umbrella
- You just broke something valuable
- You're trying to hold in a sneeze
- You accidentally sent a text to the wrong person
- You're about to blow out birthday candles
- You just got surprised with a pop quiz
- You saw someone slip on a banana peel
- You just got slimed on a game show
