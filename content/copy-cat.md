We're going to play a game called Copy Cat! Here's how it works:

Everyone stand up and face me. I'm going to do a series of actions -- clapping, waving, jumping, touching my nose -- and you need to **copy exactly** what I do.

**But** there is one move you must **never** copy: **hands on head**. If I put my hands on my head and you copy it, you're **out!**

I'll start slow and speed up, so pay attention. Last person standing wins. Ready? Let's go!
