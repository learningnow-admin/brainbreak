We're going to play a game called **Copy Cat**!

### How to Play:

1. Everyone stands up and faces the teacher
2. The teacher performs **actions** -- clapping, waving, jumping, touching their nose, etc.
3. Everyone must **copy exactly** what the teacher does
4. **But** there is one forbidden move: **hands on head**
5. If the teacher puts their **hands on their head**, you must **NOT** copy it
6. Anyone who copies the hands on head move is **out!**

### Tips:

- Start slow and build up speed to catch people off guard
- Mix in lots of different moves before sneaking in the hands on head
- Try faking it -- move your hands upward but touch your shoulders instead to trick people
- The last person standing wins!
