We’re going to play Charades! Here’s how it works:

One player will receive a word or phrase to act out silently — no talking allowed!
Use only your body, gestures, and facial expressions to give clues.
The rest of the group will try to guess what you’re acting out.

If you’re the one acting, do your best to show the word without using any words or sounds.
Be creative, and remember — exaggerated actions can really help!
