We’re going to play the Count Up game! Here’s how to play:

All players stand up and close their eyes.  
Any player can start by calling out “one,” followed by another player calling out “two,” and so on, until every player has called out a unique number in sequence.  
If two players call the same number at the same time, the count resets and the game restarts.

#### Variation:

Players take turns standing up, following these rules:

- Someone must always be standing.
- No more than 5 players can be standing at once.
- No one can stay standing for more than 5 seconds.
