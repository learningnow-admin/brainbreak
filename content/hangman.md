We’re going to play Hangman. Here’s how it works: I’ll think of a word, and I’ll write blanks on the board to show how many letters are in the word.
Your job is to guess the letters in the word, one at a time.
If you guess a letter correctly, I’ll write it in the right spot.
If the letter is not in the word, I’ll start drawing a hangman.
Each wrong guess means I add another part to the drawing.
The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
You can guess letters as a group, or if you think you know the whole word, you can guess the word.
If you guess the word before the hangman is completed, you win!
If not, we’ll reveal the word, and we’ll start a new round.
