We’re going to play a game called Scissors, Paper, Rock Katamari! Here’s how it works:

Everyone starts by finding a partner and playing a best-of-three round of Scissors, Paper, Rock.
If you win, you move on. If you lose, you become the hype person for the winner — join their team and cheer them on!

Winners pair up with other winners for the next round, and each time, the losing player (and their cheering squad) joins the winning side.
The teams grow and grow like a katamari!

We keep going until only two players are left, each backed by a big group of supporters.
They face off in the final match — one last game to crown the ultimate champion!
