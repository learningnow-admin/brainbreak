We're going to do a thought experiment called **Newcomb's Problem**. Here's how it works:

A generous predictor wants to reward people who trust them. They set up a game:

- **Box A** contains $1,000 (you can see it).
- **Box B** is hidden. It has either $1,000,000 or nothing.

The predictor has already looked at you and decided what kind of person you are:
- If they think you'll **trust them** and take only Box B → they put $1,000,000 in it.
- If they think you'll be **greedy** and grab both boxes → they left Box B empty.

The predictor is never wrong.

**What do you choose?**

Stand up if you would take only Box B.

Stay seated if you would take both boxes.

Most people take only Box B and get the million. But some people argue: "The money is already in there or it isn't — I can't change that now, so I should grab both boxes for an extra $1,000."

**What do you think?** Can you outsmart a perfect predictor? Or does trying to outsmart them mean they already predicted that?
