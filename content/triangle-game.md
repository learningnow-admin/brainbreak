We’re going to play a quiet focus game called **Triangle**.  
We’ll need to be **outside** or in a **large open space**.

### Here’s how it works:

We all stand in a big circle.  
**Silently**, each of us **chooses two other people** in the group (don’t say who!).  
Your goal is to keep the **same distance** from both — to form a triangle with equal sides.  
That’s called an **equilateral triangle**.

### What You Do:

- Watch your two people and move to stay the same distance from both
- They’re moving too — so your triangle will shift
- Move **slowly**, **quietly**, and **stay focused**
- You might need to move **backwards**, **sideways**, or **far away**
- **No talking. No rushing. Just steady, careful movement**

**Ready? Choose your two people… and begin.**
