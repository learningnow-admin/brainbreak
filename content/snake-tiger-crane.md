We’re going to play a game called Snake, Tiger, Crane! Here’s how it works:

It’s like Scissors, Paper, Rock — but with full-body movements. Here are the three actions:

- **Snake** – Place one elbow on your hand like a slithering snake.
- **Tiger** – Crouch low with your hands forward like a tiger ready to pounce.
- **Crane** – Stand on one leg with both hands up like a graceful crane.

I’ll say: **“One, two, three… hup!”**  
On “hup,” everyone strikes one of the three poses.

If you do the **same action as me**, you’re out and take a bow.  
We keep going until there’s one person left — the winner!
