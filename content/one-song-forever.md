We’re going to play a game called One Song Forever. Here’s how it works: In groups of two to four, discuss the question, “If you had to listen to one song for the rest of your life, what would it be?” Each person shares their choice and explains why they picked it. Compare answers, debate your choices, and see if anyone else agrees—or completely disagrees!
