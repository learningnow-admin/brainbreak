We’re going to play a game called Is It Water? Here’s how it works:

Imagine you're a scientist exploring a different planet.  
You find a mysterious liquid that forms oceans and rivers, turns to steam when heated, freezes when cold, and is used by trees — just like water on Earth.

But when you test it, you discover something surprising: its chemical makeup is **not** H₂O.

Talk with your elbow buddy first:  
**Should we still call this liquid water? Why or why not?**

Then we’ll share our ideas as a class!
