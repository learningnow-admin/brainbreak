We're going to do a thought experiment about **Future Discounting**. Here's how it works:

**Choice 1:**
Would you rather have $100 today, or $110 in one month?

Stand up if you'd take the $100 today.

**Choice 2:**
Would you rather have $100 in 12 months, or $110 in 13 months?

Stand up if you'd take the $100 in 12 months.

The waiting time is the same — one month — but most people answer differently. We tend to value things less the further away they are. This is called **temporal discounting**.

Here's the big question: Should your future self matter as much as your present self? Is the person you'll be in 30 years still *you*?

Let's discuss why we treat our future selves like strangers.
