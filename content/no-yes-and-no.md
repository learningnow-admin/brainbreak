We’re going to play a game called No, Yes and No. Here’s how it works: One student will ask another student a series of questions, and the answering student must respond without saying "yes" or "no." They’ll need to be creative with their answers to avoid these words. If the answering student slips and says "yes" or "no," they’re out, and another student takes their place. The game continues, testing everyone’s quick thinking and ability to dodge those forbidden words!
