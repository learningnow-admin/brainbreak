We’re going to play a game called **Stuck in the Mud**! Here’s how it works:

One or more people are the **taggers**. They chase everyone else.  
If you're **tagged**, you **freeze** and stand with your legs apart. You're “**stuck in the mud**.”  
To be **freed**, another player must **crawl under your legs**.  
You can’t move or help until someone does.

The game ends when **everyone is stuck**, or after a **set time**.

### Key Rule:

If you're stuck, you must **freeze completely** until freed.

### Variation: Card Rules

Add a twist! Everyone gets a **playing card** (keep it secret or wear it visibly).  
Players are split into two teams:

- **Freezers** (taggers)
- **Free-ers** (runners)

You can **only tag or free** someone if their card is **lower than yours**.

**Examples:**

- A **Queen** can tag or free a **10**, but not a **King**
- A **3** can’t tag or free anyone except **2** or **Ace**

**Special Rule:**

- The **Ace** can be tagged by anyone
- Only the **Ace** can tag the **King**

The rest of the rules stay the same.
