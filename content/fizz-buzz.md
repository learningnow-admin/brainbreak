We’re going to play a game called **Fizz Buzz**! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands or sits in a **circle**.  
We’ll go around the circle **counting up** one number at a time.  
But instead of saying certain numbers, you’ll say **“Fizz,” “Buzz,” or “Fizz Buzz.”**

### The Rules:

- Say **“Fizz”** if the number is **divisible by 3**
- Say **“Buzz”** if the number is **divisible by 5**
- Say **“Fizz Buzz”** if it’s **divisible by both** 3 and 5
- For all other numbers, just say the number

### Example:

- 1 → “1”
- 2 → “2”
- 3 → “Fizz”
- 5 → “Buzz”
- 6 → “Fizz”
- 15 → “Fizz Buzz”

### Variant Rule (Optional Twist):

Say “Fizz” for numbers that **contain a 3** (like 13)  
Say “Buzz” for numbers that **contain a 5** (like 52)

**Want to play classic or with the twist? Let’s start at 1… Ready?**
