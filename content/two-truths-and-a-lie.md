We’re going to play a game called Two Truths and a Lie. Here’s how it works: Each person takes a turn introducing themselves by sharing two true statements and one lie about themselves. These statements can be about hobbies, experiences, or interests. The goal is for the group to guess which statement is the lie.

The lie can be as creative or believable as you like, while the truths can include surprising or unique facts to keep everyone guessing. Each player shares their three statements aloud, and the group discusses and votes on which one they believe is the lie.
