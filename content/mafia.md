We’re going to play a game called **Mafia**.

Everyone, come sit in a circle. I’m going to hand out **secret roles**.  
Don’t show anyone your role. Don’t say it out loud. Just remember it.

Here’s how the roles work — listen carefully:

- **Two of you are Mafia.** You’re on the same team. Each night, you’ll secretly choose one person to eliminate.
- **One of you is the Doctor.** Each night, you’ll choose someone to save. You can save yourself.
- **One of you is the Detective.** Each night, you’ll pick one person to investigate. I’ll tell you if that person is Mafia.
- **Everyone else is a Villager.** Your job is to help figure out who the Mafia are and vote them out.

Now, here’s how the game works:

### Night Time

Everyone closes their eyes.

First, **Mafia**, open your eyes and silently agree on one person to eliminate. Then close your eyes.

Next, **Doctor**, open your eyes and point to one person to save. Then close your eyes.

Then, **Detective**, open your eyes and point to one person to investigate. I’ll nod yes or no. Then close your eyes.

Everyone’s eyes stay closed until I say to open them.

### Day Time

Now open your eyes.

I’ll tell you what happened during the night — someone might be out, or the Doctor might have saved them.

Now it’s time to talk. You can ask questions, make guesses, accuse people, defend yourself — just talk it out.

After a short time, we’ll vote. Everyone points to one person they think might be Mafia. The person with the most votes is out.

### The Goal

If you’re **Mafia**, your goal is to stay hidden and eliminate everyone else.  
If you’re a **Villager**, your goal is to find the Mafia and vote them out.

Villagers win if both Mafia are gone.  
Mafia win if they outnumber the rest.

Everyone ready? Eyes closed — it’s night time…
