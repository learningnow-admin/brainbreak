We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Experience Machine**. Here's how it works:

Imagine scientists have created a machine you can plug into for the rest of your life. Once connected, you'll experience a perfect simulation — you'll fall in love, achieve your dreams, have amazing adventures. It will feel completely real. You won't know you're in a machine.

But none of it will actually be happening. Your real body just floats in a tank.

**Would you plug in?**

Stand up if you would plug into the machine.

Stay seated if you would choose to stay in the real world.

If you said no — why? The experiences feel identical. What's the difference between "real" happiness and simulated happiness if you can't tell them apart?

Does reality matter, or only how things feel?
