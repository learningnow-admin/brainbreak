We’re going to play a game called Stand Up If. Here’s how it works: Everyone starts seated. I’ll read out a statement. If a statement is true for you, you stand up. Look around, notice who else is standing, then sit back down. It’s a great way to learn more about each other. The game continues with new statements. Let’s see what we all have in common.
