We’re going to play a game called Follow the Leader. Here’s how it works: One student will step outside the room while we quietly choose a leader. The leader will then start a rhythmic pattern, like clapping, tapping, or snapping, and everyone else will follow along, copying the leader’s actions. The leader can change the rhythm or movements at any time, and everyone must keep following along without making it obvious who they’re following. When the student comes back in, they’ll watch closely to try and guess who the leader is. Remember, try not to look directly at the leader to keep it challenging!
