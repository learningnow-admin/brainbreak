We’re going to play a game called Wink Murder! Here’s how it works:

One player is the moderator. While everyone else closes their eyes, the moderator secretly picks one person to be the murderer.

When the game begins, everyone walks around, chats casually, and makes eye contact.
The murderer “kills” by winking at other players.

If you get winked at, wait a few seconds, then dramatically “die” and sit to the side.
Everyone else keeps watching closely, trying to figure out who the murderer is.

Think you know who it is? Say, “I accuse!”
If someone else agrees, they say, “I support!” and the accusation goes ahead.
If you’re right, the murderer is caught and the game ends. If you’re wrong, you’re out — and the game continues.
