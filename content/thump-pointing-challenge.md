We’re going to play a game called Thumb Pointing Challenge! Here’s how it works:

**Start:**  
Left hand – Thumbs up  
Right hand – Pointer finger pointing at the left thumb

**Switch:**  
Swap so your **left hand points** and your **right hand gives a thumbs up**.

**Repeat:**  
Keep switching back and forth as fast as you can without messing up!

The goal is to stay coordinated and move quickly without losing track.
