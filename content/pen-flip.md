We’re going to do a Pen Flipping Challenge. Here’s how it works:

#### Dominant Hand Flip:

We’ll start by flipping the pen using just one hand – your dominant hand.  
The goal is to make a full rotation of the pen around your thumb.

#### Non-Dominant Hand Flip:

Next, switch to your non-dominant hand and try the same thing – a full pen rotation around your thumb.

#### Both Hands Flip:

Finally, we’ll try flipping a pen in both hands at the same time!

The goal is to master flipping the pen smoothly in all three ways.  
If you drop the pen, don’t worry – just pick it up and try again!
