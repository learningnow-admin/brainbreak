We’re going to play a game called Simon Says! Here’s how it works:

I’ll give you a series of instructions, but only follow the ones that start with **“Simon says.”**  
If I give an instruction **without saying “Simon says,”** don’t follow it!

If you move when I didn’t say “Simon says,” you’re out for that round.  
The goal is to stay in the game by listening carefully and only doing the right commands.

Ready? Let’s go!
