We’re going to play Rock, Paper, Scissors … Maths! Here’s how it works:

Pair up with someone.
Both players say, “Rock, paper, scissors… maths!” and hold out a random number of fingers (like 2, 5, etc.) instead of the usual rock, paper, or scissors symbols.
The first person to say the correct sum of both players' numbers wins that round!
You can mix it up by calling out for different operations like addition, subtraction, or even multiplication before starting each round.

Ready? Let’s see who can think fast and win the most rounds!
