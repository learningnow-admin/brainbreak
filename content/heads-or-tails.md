We’re going to play Heads or Tails Pose! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands up and picks a pose:

- **Heads** – Put both hands on your head
- **Tails** – Put both hands on your bottom
- **Combo** – One hand on your head, one on your bottom

I’ll toss a coin.  
If it lands on heads, and you chose **Heads**, stay standing.  
If it lands on tails, and you chose **Tails**, stay standing.  
If your pose doesn’t match the coin, sit down.

We keep going until only one person is left standing.  
That person wins the game!
