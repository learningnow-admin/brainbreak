We’re going to play a thought experiment game based on a classic philosophy puzzle called **Mary’s Room**. Here’s how it works:

Imagine Mary lives in a completely black-and-white room.  
She only has access to black-and-white books and screens.  
All her knowledge about colour comes from reading and studying through black-and-white images.  
She knows everything there is to know about the science of colour vision — in physics, biology, and beyond.

One day, her screen breaks and suddenly shows the colour **red**.  
For the first time, Mary actually sees colour.

Now for the big question:  
**Does Mary learn anything new when she sees red, even though she already knows all the scientific facts about colour?**

This puzzle is about a philosophical idea called **qualia** — the personal, first-hand experience of something, like how _you_ see red or feel pain.  
Let’s talk about what that might mean!
