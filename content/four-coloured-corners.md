We’re going to play a game called Four Corners. Here’s how it works: Each corner of the room is given a colour—red, blue, green, or yellow. One person stands in the middle, closes their eyes, and counts down from ten. Everyone else quietly picks a corner. When the count ends, the person in the middle pulls a colour from a bag. Anyone standing in the corner that matches the chosen colour is out. The last player remaining wins.
