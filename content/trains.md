We’re going to play a game called **Trains**! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands in a circle and holds hands lightly or stays close enough to touch.  
I’ll start by sending a **pulse (a gentle squeeze)** to the person next to me.  
If you **feel a pulse**, you must **send it on** to the next person.

But there’s a twist! Some of you will be **special stations**:

### Special Stations:

- **Doubler** – Turn 1 pulse into 2 (tap twice quickly)
- **Halver** – Turn 2 pulses into 1, or 4 into 2
- **Reverse** – Send the pulse back the way it came

Your job is to **keep the pulse moving**, watch closely, and think fast.
