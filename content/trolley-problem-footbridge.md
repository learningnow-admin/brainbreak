We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Footbridge Problem**. Here's how it works:

A runaway trolley is heading toward five people on the tracks. You are standing on a footbridge above the tracks. Next to you is a large stranger. The only way to stop the trolley is to push this person off the bridge — their body would stop the trolley and save the five.

**Do nothing:** Five people die.
**Push the stranger:** One person dies, but five are saved.

Stand up if you would push the stranger.

Stay seated if you would do nothing.

Many people who would pull a lever won't push someone. Why does using your hands feel different from pulling a lever — even though the outcome is the same?
