We’re going to play a game called Blind Artist! Here’s how it works:

Pair up and sit back-to-back.
One of you will be the Describer, and the other will be the Artist.

The Describer looks at a picture and explains what they see — but no saying the name of the object!
The Artist listens carefully and tries to draw the picture based only on the description.

Let’s see how close the drawings come to the real thing!
