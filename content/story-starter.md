We’re going to play a game called Story Starter! Here’s how it works:

In pairs, take turns saying **one sentence at a time** to build a story together.  
When I say “end,” try to finish your story in the next 2–3 turns.

Want a challenge? Try the variation — build the story **one word at a time** instead of full sentences.  
It gets tricky and unpredictable, but that’s part of the fun!
