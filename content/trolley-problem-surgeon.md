We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Surgeon's Dilemma**. Here's how it works:

Imagine you are a surgeon. In your hospital, five patients will die today unless they each receive an organ transplant — each needs a different organ. A healthy traveller comes in for a routine check-up. Their organs are a perfect match for all five patients.

**Do nothing:** Five patients die.
**Take the traveller's organs:** One healthy person dies, but five are saved.

Stand up if the surgeon should take the organs.

Most people say yes to the classic trolley lever but no to this. Why? The numbers are the same — one life for five. What makes this feel so different?
