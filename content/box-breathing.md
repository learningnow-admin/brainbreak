We’re going to do some Box Breathing. Here’s how it works: We’ll all follow a simple breathing pattern together—inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold again for four seconds before repeating. Imagine tracing the sides of a box with your breath—each step is one side of the box. We’ll do this a few times, and then we’ll see who can keep their breathing the smoothest and most controlled. Stay focused, stay relaxed, and let’s see how calm and steady we can be! If at any point you feel lightheaded or uncomfortable, just return to your normal breathing.
