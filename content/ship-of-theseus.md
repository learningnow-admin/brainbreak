We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Ship of Theseus**. Here's how it works:

Imagine a famous ship. Over many years, every single plank of wood rots and gets replaced with a new one. Eventually, not a single original piece remains.

**Is it still the same ship?**

Stand up if you think yes, it's the same ship.

Stay seated if you think no, it's a different ship.

**Now here's the twist:** Someone has collected all the old rotting planks and built a ship from them.

Which one is the *real* Ship of Theseus — the one that was continuously repaired, or the one made from the original parts?

This applies to you too — your body replaces almost all its cells over time. Are you the same person you were 10 years ago?
