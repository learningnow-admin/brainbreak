We’re going to play a game called Mouse Running Around the Circle! Here’s how it works:

There’s an **imaginary mouse** running around the circle.  
As it scurries past you, **lift your legs** to let it run underneath.

The goal is to keep the mouse moving and enjoy the fun of imagining the chase.  
Let’s see how smoothly we can keep it going
