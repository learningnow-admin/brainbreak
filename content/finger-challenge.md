We’re going to play a game called Finger Challenge! Here’s how it works:

Put your hands together with your **middle finger knuckles touching**.  
Now, one by one, try to lift and separate each pair of fingers:

- First your **thumbs**
- Then your **index fingers**
- Then your **pinkies**
- And finally, your **ring fingers**

Some will be easier than others!  
Stay focused, control your movements, and see if you can lift them all.
