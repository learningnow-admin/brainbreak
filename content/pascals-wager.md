We're going to do a thought experiment called **Pascal's Wager**. Here's how it works:

The philosopher Blaise Pascal argued that believing in God is a rational bet:

- **If God exists and you believe:** Infinite reward (heaven).
- **If God exists and you don't believe:** Infinite loss (hell).
- **If God doesn't exist and you believe:** Small loss (some time and effort).
- **If God doesn't exist and you don't believe:** Small gain (a bit more freedom).

Pascal said: Even if God probably doesn't exist, the potential infinite reward makes believing the smart bet.

**Do you find this argument convincing?**

Stand up if you think Pascal's logic makes sense.

Stay seated if you see problems with it.

Some questions to consider:
- Can you choose to believe something?
- What if you pick the wrong god?
- Is believing "just in case" genuine belief?
