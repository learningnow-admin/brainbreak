We're going to play Jelly Bean! Here's how it works:

Everyone stand up. There are six different beans -- learn the move for each one:

- **Jelly bean** – shimmer your hands (wiggle your fingers like jelly)
- **Broad bean** – hands on your hips
- **String bean** – one hand straight up in the air
- **Running bean** – run on the spot
- **Coffee bean** – pretend to drink a cup of coffee
- **Frozen bean** – freeze completely still

I'll call out the beans and we'll all do the moves together a few times to learn them.

Then I'm going to **try to trick you!** I'll call out one bean but do a **different** one.
You have to follow **what I say**, not **what I do**!

Ready? Let's go!
