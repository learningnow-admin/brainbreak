We’re going to play the Draw My Picture Game! Here’s how it works:

Grab a piece of paper and a pencil, and make sure your paper is placed vertically.  
Follow these steps carefully:

1. Draw a medium-sized circle in the middle of your paper.
2. Below the circle, draw a medium-sized square, with the top of the square touching the bottom of the circle.
3. Inside the square, draw a medium-sized heart.
4. On each side of the square, draw a smaller rectangle, placed horizontally so they touch the square. The tops of the rectangles should line up with the top of the square.
5. Above the circle, draw a medium-sized triangle, with the bottom of the triangle touching the top of the circle.
6. Inside the triangle, draw three small stars anywhere you like.
7. In the centre of the circle, draw a small triangle.
8. Below the small triangle, draw an arc that curves upwards (like a smile).
9. Above the small triangle, draw two small circles, one slightly to the right and one slightly to the left.
