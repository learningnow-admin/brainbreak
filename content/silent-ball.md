We’re going to play a game called Silent Ball. Here’s how it works: Everyone must stay completely silent while passing a ball to each other. You can only use hand signals or eye contact to communicate. If you drop the ball, make noise, or throw it too wildly, you're out. Stay focused, stay quiet, and see how long you can keep the game going.
