We’re going to play a game called **Zone Dash Tag!** Here’s how it works:

The area is divided into zones. Each zone has a tagger who can’t leave their zone.  
Runners try to make it across all zones without being tagged.

Follow these steps:

- Divide the play space into **4 zones**
- Place **1 tagger** in each zone (they stay inside their zone)
- Runners try to cross **all zones** without being tagged
- If tagged, players are out (or complete a short challenge to return)
- After a set time, taggers must do **5 star jumps** before tagging again
