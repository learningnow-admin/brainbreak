We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Veil of Ignorance**. Here's how it works:

Imagine you get to design the rules of society — laws, wealth distribution, rights, everything. But here's the catch: you don't know what position you'll have in that society. You could be born rich or poor, healthy or disabled, part of a majority or minority.

Behind this "veil of ignorance," you don't know who you'll be.

**How would you design society?**

Think about these questions:
- How much should the richest person have compared to the poorest?
- What rights should everyone have?
- How should we treat people who can't work?

Stand up if you would design a society where everyone is more equal.

Stay seated if you would allow big differences, hoping you might end up on top.

Does not knowing your position change what you think is fair?
