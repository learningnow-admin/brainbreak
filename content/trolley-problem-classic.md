We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Trolley Problem**. Here's how it works:

Imagine a runaway trolley is speeding down the tracks. Ahead, five people are tied to the tracks and cannot escape. You are standing next to a lever. If you pull the lever, the trolley will switch to a side track — but there is one person tied to that track.

**Do nothing:** Five people die.
**Pull the lever:** One person dies, but you actively caused their death.

Stand up if you would pull the lever.

Stay seated if you would do nothing.

Let's discuss: Is there a difference between killing someone and letting someone die?
