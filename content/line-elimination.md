We’re going to play a game called **Line Elimination!** Here’s how it works:

You’ll run to court or field lines — but don’t be the last one there!

Follow these steps:

- Spread out on a court or field with visible lines
- Teacher calls out a line (e.g., **“centre line!”**)
- Everyone runs to that line
- The **last person** there is out
- Keep going until only one person is left
