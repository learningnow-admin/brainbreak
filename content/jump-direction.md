We're going to play a game called Jump Direction! Here's how it works:

Everyone stand up. I'm going to point out the four compass directions in the room -- **North, South, East and West**.

When I call out a direction, you need to **jump to face** that direction as fast as you can. The **last person** to face the correct direction is **out**.

Listen carefully -- I might call the same direction twice in a row to catch you off guard, and I'll speed up as we go!

Last person standing wins. Ready? Let's go!
