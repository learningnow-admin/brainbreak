We're going to play a game called **Jump Direction**!

### Setup:

The teacher points out the four compass directions in the room:
- **North**
- **South**
- **East**
- **West**

Everyone stands up and faces the teacher.

### How to Play:

1. The teacher calls out a direction, e.g. **"North!"**
2. Everyone must **jump to face** that direction as fast as they can
3. The **last person** to face the correct direction is **out**
4. Keep going until there's one person left standing -- they're the winner!

### Tips:

- Call directions quickly to keep the energy up
- Mix in unexpected switches like calling the same direction twice in a row
- You can speed up as the game goes on to make it harder
