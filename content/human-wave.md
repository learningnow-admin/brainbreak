We’re going to play a game called Human Wave! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands in a line or a circle.  
One person starts by doing a simple movement — like raising their arms, clapping, or spinning.  
The next person copies the movement right away, and it continues around the group like a wave!

#### Variations:
- **Reverse Wave:** Send the wave back the other way.  
- **Add-On Wave:** Each person adds a new movement before passing it along.  
- **Speed Wave:** Try to pass the wave as fast as you can without breaking the rhythm.

Let’s see how smooth we can make our wave!
