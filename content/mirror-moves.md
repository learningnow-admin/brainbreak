We’re going to play a game called Mirror Moves. Here’s how it works: You get into pairs and stand facing each other. One person starts as the leader and performs slow, deliberate movements, while the other person mirrors their moves exactly, like a reflection in a mirror. After a set amount of time, you switch roles and continue. The aim is to stay perfectly in sync and enjoy the challenge!
