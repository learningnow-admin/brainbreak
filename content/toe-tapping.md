We’re going to play a game called Toe Tapping with a partner! Here’s how it works:

You and your partner will tap your feet in a specific pattern.  
Follow this sequence:

- Tap **once** with your right foot
- Tap **three times** with your left foot
- Tap **twice** with your right foot

The pattern is: **1-3-2**

Keep going and try to stay in sync with your partner!
