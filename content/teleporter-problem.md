We're going to do a thought experiment called **The Teleporter Problem**. Here's how it works:

Imagine a teleporter that works by scanning every atom in your body, destroying you, and then rebuilding an exact copy at the destination. The copy has all your memories, personality, and thinks they're you.

**Would you use this teleporter?**

Stand up if you would use it.

Stay seated if you wouldn't.

**Now consider this:** What if the machine malfunctions and doesn't destroy the original? There are now two of you, both equally convinced they're the real you.

Which one is actually you? Both? Neither?

If the copy is you, does that mean you die every time you use the teleporter — and a new person just thinks they survived?
