We’re going to do a thought experiment called The Drowning Child Dilemma. Here’s how it works: Imagine you are walking down the street and notice a child drowning in a lake. You can swim and are close enough to save her if you act immediately. However, doing so will ruin your expensive shoes. Stand up if you believe you have an obligation to save the child.

Now, consider this: If you believe saving a child in immediate danger is an obligation, is there a fundamental difference between saving a child in front of you and one on the other side of the world? Stand up if you don’t think there is a difference.
