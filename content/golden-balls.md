We’re going to play a game called Golden Balls, based on the classic Prisoner’s Dilemma. Here’s how it works:

You and your partner will each decide whether to **share** or **steal** a prize.  
The prize is a sum of fake money, and what you choose will determine how it's divided.

Before making your choice, you’ll have a short conversation with your partner.  
Then, you’ll secretly write your decision — **share** or **steal** — on a piece of paper.

Here’s what can happen:

- If you **both choose share**, you each get half the prize.
- If one **shares** and the other **steals**, the person who steals gets everything, and the one who shares gets nothing.
- If you **both choose steal**, neither of you gets anything.

The challenge: Can you trust your partner? Should you cooperate or go for it all?
