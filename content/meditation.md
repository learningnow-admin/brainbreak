We’re going to do a short, quiet meditation for about **two minutes**.  

Start by sitting comfortably. Let your hands rest in your lap or on your knees.  
Close your eyes, or just lower your gaze and let it soften.

Take a slow breath in through your nose… and gently breathe out through your mouth.  
Let your shoulders drop. Let your jaw relax. Let your body be still.

Now bring your attention to your breath.  
Feel the air as it comes in… and goes out.  
You don’t need to change anything — just notice the breath moving through your body.

If your mind starts to wander, that’s okay.  
Just gently guide your focus back to your breath — in… and out…

Let your thoughts come and go, like clouds drifting across the sky.  
You don’t need to chase them. Just notice them, and return to your breathing.

We’ll stay here together for the next two minutes — breathing slowly and quietly.  
I’ll let you know when time is up.

[Pause here for 2 minutes.]

Now take one more slow, deep breath in… and out…  
Gently bring your attention back to the room.  
When you’re ready, open your eyes or lift your gaze.
