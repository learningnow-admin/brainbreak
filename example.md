Write as direction instructions for the students.  Each brain break should tell us exactly what to do, step by step.  When the teacher reads it word for word, the teacher and students should understand immediately without extra explanation.  Use collective first person (e.g., "we").
Write in plain, concrete words so that anyone could read it out loud without needing to change or improvise.
