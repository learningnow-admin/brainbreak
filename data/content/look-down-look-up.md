We’re going to play Look Up, Look Down! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands in a circle, facing inwards. Around 10–12 people in a group works best.
Look down at the small object placed in the centre of the circle.

When I say, “Look up,” quickly look directly at one person in the circle — choose secretly!
If the person you’re looking at is also looking right at you, you’re both out. Step out of the circle.

I’ll then say, “Look down,” and we reset for the next round.

We keep going until only one or two players are left.
