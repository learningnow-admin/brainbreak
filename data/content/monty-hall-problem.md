We’re going to play a game based on the famous Monty Hall Problem. Here’s how it works:

- You’re presented with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a shiny car, and behind the other two doors are goats.
- You choose one door (but don’t open it yet!).
- The host, Monty, who knows what’s behind all the doors, will open one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.
- Now, Monty gives you a choice: Stick with your original door or Switch to the other remaining door.
  The goal is to figure out if you should stick or switch to have the best chance of winning the car!
