We’re going to play a game called Four Corners. Here’s how it works: I will assign numbers to each corner of the room: 1, 2, 3, and 4. One person will be the caller, and they will stand in the middle with their eyes closed. Everyone else will quietly move to one of the four corners. You can choose whichever one you like. Once you’ve all picked a corner, the caller will call out a number between 1 and 4. If you’re in the corner that was called, you’re out and will sit down. Everyone who is still in the game will choose a new corner, and we’ll keep playing until only one person is left. That person will be the winner and will become the next caller.
