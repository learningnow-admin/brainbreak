We’re going to play a game called **Using the Letters of Your Name!** Here’s how it works:

Everyone writes their name on a piece of paper.  
Then, for **each letter**, think of a **word that starts with that letter**.  
Try to make the words as **strange or obscure** as possible — no “Apple” for A!

For example, if your name is **LUCY**:

- **L** – _Lint_
- **U** – _Umbra_
- **C** – _Cacophony_
- **Y** – _Yaffle_

Be ready to explain what your words mean!
