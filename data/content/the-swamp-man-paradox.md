We’re going to do a thought experiment called **The Swampman Paradox**. Here’s how it works:

Imagine a man is out walking when a bolt of lightning suddenly disintegrates him.  
At the same moment, another bolt strikes a nearby swamp, causing a bunch of molecules to randomly rearrange into **an exact copy** of the man — same body, same brain, same memories.

This “**Swampman**” goes about life just like the original man: working, speaking, and interacting with the same people — and no one can tell the difference.

Now the big question:  
**Is the Swampman the same person as the one who was disintegrated?**

Stand up if you believe **yes**, they’re the same person.  
Stay seated if you believe **no**, they’re different.
