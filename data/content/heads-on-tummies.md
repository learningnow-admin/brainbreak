Weâ€™re going to play a game called **Heads on Tummies**! Hereâ€™s how it works:

Everyone lies down on the floor in a line or a circle.  
Each person puts their **head on someone elseâ€™s tummy**, and someone puts their head on yours.  
Try to stay still and quietâ€¦ but it wonâ€™t be easy!

ðŸ’¬ _Comment to teacher:_  
If one student laughs, their tummy moves, which jiggles someone elseâ€™s head.  
That often makes them laugh, and the cycle continues.  
Itâ€™s a fun, natural **chain reaction of giggles**!

**Ready to give it a go?** Lie down, heads on tummies, and try not to laugh!
