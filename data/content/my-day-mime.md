We’re going to play a game called My Day Mime! Here’s how it works:

Think of a day you really enjoyed.  
Now, act out parts of that day using only movements — no talking or sounds allowed!

The rest of us will try to guess what you’re doing.  
Let’s see how much of your day we can figure out, just by watching!
