We’re going to play Stir the Pot! Here’s how it works: Imagine you’re standing in front of a giant cauldron filled with sticky caramel. Grab a big stirrer and push it all the way to the bottom of the pot. Begin stirring slowly in a clockwise direction, using your whole body—wrists, arms, and shoulders. After about a minute or two, switch and stir in the opposite direction. Make sure to use your full range of motion!
