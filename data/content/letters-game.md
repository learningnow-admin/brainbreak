We’re going to play a game called Letters Game! Here’s how it works:

You’ll be given a random selection of **nine letters**.  
Your goal is to make as many words as possible using only those letters.  
You can **rearrange** them any way you like, but remember:  
Each letter can only be used as many times as it appears.

When time is up, compare your words.  
The player with the **longest valid word** or the **most words** wins!
