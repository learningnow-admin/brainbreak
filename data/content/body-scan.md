We’re going to do a quiet body scan to help us relax.  
Sit or lie down comfortably and close your eyes.

Start by bringing your attention to your **toes**.  
Can you feel them touching your shoes or the floor? Are they warm or cool? Still or wiggly?

Now move your attention slowly up to your **feet**… your **ankles**… your **lower legs**.  
Notice any feelings — tightness, tingling, or just stillness.

Bring your focus to your **knees**, then your **thighs**.  
Feel the chair or ground supporting you.

Now move to your **belly** — is it rising and falling as you breathe?

Bring your attention to your **chest**, then your **shoulders**.  
Can you let them drop a little? Let go of any tightness.

Now feel your **arms**… your **hands**… right down to your fingertips.

Finally, focus on your **neck**, your **face**, and the top of your **head**.  
Relax your jaw. Soften your eyes. Let your face be calm.

Take one more slow breath in… and out.  
When you're ready, gently open your eyes.
