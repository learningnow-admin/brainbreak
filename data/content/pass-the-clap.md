We’re going to play a game called Pass the Clap! Here’s how it works:

Everyone stands in a circle. The goal is to pass a clap around the circle while following these rules:

- **Single Clap (Pass):** Clap once to pass the clap to the next person.
- **Double Clap (Reverse):** Clap twice to reverse the direction.
- **Triple Clap (Jump):** Clap three times to skip the next person and pass it to the one after them.

The aim is to keep the rhythm smooth and flowing.  
If someone hesitates or gets it wrong, they’re out for the round.
