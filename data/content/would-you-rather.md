We’re going to play a game called Would You Rather. Here’s how it works: I’ll read out a question with two choices—for example, “Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?” One side of the room is for the first option, the other side is for the second. You show your choice by walking to the side that matches your answer. Take a moment to look around and see who chose what.
