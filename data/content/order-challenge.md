We’re going to play a game called Order Challenge! Here’s how it works:

In small groups, you’ll take turns arranging yourselves in the correct order based on different challenges.  
Talk it through, figure it out, and move into place!

Here are your order challenges:

- **Tallest to Shortest** – Stand in a line from the tallest person to the shortest.
- **Longest Hair to Shortest Hair** – Rearrange based on the length of your hair.
- **Oldest to Youngest** – Line up from the oldest in the group to the youngest.
- **Wake-Up Time** – From the earliest riser to the one who sleeps in the most.
- **Alphabetical Order by First Name** – Line up from A to Z by your first names.
- **Alphabetical Order by Last Name** – Now try it with your last names.
- **Birth Month** – Arrange yourselves from January to December.
- **Shoe Size** – From the largest shoe size to the smallest.

Let’s see how well you can work together to get in order!
