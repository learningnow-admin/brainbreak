We’re going to play Category Actions! Here’s how it works:

I’ll call out a category, and if it applies to you, perform the corresponding action.  
Ready to see how many categories you belong to? Here’s what to do for each one:

- **Have a brother** – Click your fingers
- **Have lived in more than 2 houses** – Clap your hands twice
- **Wearing a watch** – Beat your chest
- **Prefer the winter** – Give yourself a hug
- **Like sunny days** – Wink
- **Made your bed this morning** – Take a bow
- **Completed set homework this week** – Thumbs up
- **Play a team sport** – Jump on the spot
