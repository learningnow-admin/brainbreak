We’re going to play a game called Dead Fish! Here’s how it works:

Everyone lies down on the floor and becomes a **dead fish** — no moving, no twitching, no giggling.  
Your goal is to stay **as still as possible** for as long as you can.

I’ll walk around and watch carefully.  
If you move, you’re out.

The fish who stay completely still the longest are the winners — there might be more than one!
