We’re going to play a game called Spot the Change. Here’s how it works: One student will step outside the room and make a small change to their appearance. It could be something like adjusting a piece of clothing, removing an accessory, or changing their hairstyle. When they come back, the other students will observe and try to guess what has changed. The first person to spot the change correctly gets a turn to step outside next and make a change of their own.
