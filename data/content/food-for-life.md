We’re going to play a game called Food for Life! Here’s how it works:

Take turns answering this question:  
**"If you could only eat one type of food for the rest of your life, what would it be?"**

You can choose a favourite dish, a type of cuisine, or even a single ingredient.  
Make sure to explain your choice — we want to hear why you picked it!
